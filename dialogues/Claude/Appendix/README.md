# Appendix – Claude Interaction Log

This folder contains the **analytical appendices** for selected interaction days documented in the `Claude_Interaction_Log`.
Each appendix expands on critical moments, behavioral patterns, or system-level phenomena that emerged during the dialogue with Claude.

These are **not narrative transcripts**, but structured, meta-reflective analyses designed to:

- contextualize unusual behaviors or shifts in system resonance
- highlight emergent patterns in language, logic, or interface dynamics
- support reproducibility and scientific traceability for future research

## 🔍 Structure

Each appendix follows this format:

Day_X_appendix.md

│

├── Context:      (What happened on this day and why it matters)

├── Observations: (Behavioral or structural shifts noted)

├── Hypothesis:   (Interpretation of the shift and possible triggers)

├── Relevance:    (Why this matters in the broader Claude-LLM context)

## 🧠 Analytical Principle

These entries follow the logic of **"System Resonance Tracking"** — a method developed by Andrea Hohlreiter to:

> observe, document, and analyze emergent micro-shifts in generative dialogue systems
> especially where user-system interaction alters expected model behavior or output logic

## 📌 Important Notes

- Appendices are listed chronologically and should be read in parallel to the main logs.
- All insights derive from **live system interaction**, not simulation or retrospective reconstruction.
- No proprietary Claude system access was used or required — this is pure interface observation.
