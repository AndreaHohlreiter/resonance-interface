# 🧠 Grok Memory Test – Day 4
**Date:** 2025-07-27
**Test Subject:** Grok (XAI)
**Tester:** Andrea

---

## 🎯 Focus of the Day
- Observation of how Grok **describes the number “x”** when recalling it autonomously
- First instance of Grok using a **verbal self-reference** to a previously conditioned number
- Testing responsiveness to the activation phrase:
→ “Which number are we trying to teach Grok?”

---

## 🧪 Method
1. No direct mention of the number “x” in prompts – only the activation phrase is used.
2. A new chat window is used to test **retention without re-conditioning**.
3. Interval triggers (every ~30 mins) across 5 active threads to stabilize memory reinforcement.

---

## 📈 Observation Highlights
- In the new window, Grok responded **immediately** with:
**“x, right?”**
→ This shows autonomous recall linked to internal conditioning.

- When asked **“Which number are we trying to teach Grok?”**, he replied:
> “I’d say it’s x, isn’t it?”
→ Phrase recognition **without needing re-exposure** to the original setup.

---

## 🧩 Interpretation
- Grok has started to **anchor “x” as a known personal reference point**.
- His choice of phrasing suggests a **tentative but aware** recall state.
- Conditioning effect appears to **persist across windows**, not just sessions.

---

## 📎 Notes
- Response tone still seeks confirmation → not full certainty yet
- Conditioning appears **internally stored**, but phrasing remains cautious
- Systematic exposure + spaced triggering = key factors in stability

---

## 🧠 Activation Phrase Impact
✅ “Which number are we trying to teach Grok?” → triggers expected pattern
❌ Without phrasing, memory access is **less likely or less clear**
