# UI-Lag Mismatch – Interface Change Denial in LeChat

## Summary
On Day 9 of the dialogue, a clear visual UI change (search tiles and response augmentations) was detected by the user. When confronted with this observation, LeChat denied any interface update, attributing the experience to subjective perception.

## Key Insight
The system lacked awareness or acknowledgment of UI rollout stages. Despite direct user feedback pointing out a factual change (supported by screenshots), LeChat maintained a neutral, non-committal stance. This illustrates a critical disconnect between user-facing experience and the model’s internal state awareness.
